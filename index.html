            <li>Entity issuing the bonds (the issuer) pays the CRA for the credit rating</li>
            <li>This creates a clear potential conflict of interest, as the issuer could pressure the CRA to give a more favorable rating</li>

        <p>Dominated By three major CRAs, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) score : 3655 (10000 equals monopoly and 0 equals Perfect Competition) signify dominance of 3 major CRAs.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Barriers to entry is high, which is believed to be reduced by CRARA,2006.</li>
            <li>Competition affect naive investor who rely on ratings due to upwardly biased ratings</li>
            <li>If prudential regulatory reliance on ratings were reduced, and professional bond managers were given more flexibility to choose their sources of creditworthiness information, the upward bias from competition might diminish</li>
            <li>Although, Increased competition would increase innovation in ratings methodologies, technologies.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Housing Boom before Financial Crisis</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mortgage-Backed securities(MBS) were dominated by government backed firms (Ginnie mac, Fannie Mac, Freddie Mac) that was changed as in late 1990s private label MBS were introduced which contributed to housing boom with increasingly risky loans (subprime mortgages).</li>
            <li>MBS were difficult to analyze due to the variety of underlying mortgages and the tranching structure.</li>
            <li>MBS were segmented into structures according to different risk level named Tranches, which were divided into senior(Usually AAA rated) and Junior tranches (BB or even Unrated).</li>
            <li>Prices of housing declined in 2006-07 causing mortgage default to surge in subprime loans, causing massive loss in junior tranches also senior trances experience shortfalls leading downgrade of MBS.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Role of 3 Major CRAs</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>CRAs relied on historical data from a rising housing market, which showed low default rates and minimal losses.</li>
            <li>Between 2000 and 2007, 3 major CRAs were pivotal in assigning high credit ratings to senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These ratings signaled low risk, facilitating the rapid expansion of the private-label MBS market.</li>
            <li>By mid-2007, as mortgage defaults increased, CRAs began large-scale downgrades of MBS and Collateralized debt obligations.</li>
            <li>As of mid 2009, 90% of Rated CDOs and 63% of MBS which were rated AAA were downgraded (80% and 52% below of investment grade respectively)</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Regulations of Credit Rating Agencies after Financial Crisis</h2>
        <p>Financial crisis highlighted the failures of CRAs, particularly their rating of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), in Response regulatory efforts are increased.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>CRARA (2006):</strong> Introduced limited regulation of CRAs, requiring transparency and addressing conflicts of interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Dodd-Frank Act (2010):</strong> Expanded regulation of CRAs and mandated federal agencies to reduce reliance on NRSRO ratings in prudential regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>EU Regulations:</strong> Similar efforts were made in the European Union to regulate CRAs.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Drawbacks of Regulations</h2>
        <h3>1. Impact on Smaller CRAs</h3>
        <p>Regulatory costs, which are often fixed, fall more heavily on smaller CRAs, making it harder for them to compete.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Discouragement of Innovation</h3>
        <p>Stops innovation in rating, as new approaches may not align with regulatory requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Entrenchment of Major CRAs</h3>
        <p>Regulation could further entrench the dominance of the three major CRAs.</p>

        <h2>Ending Statement</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The public backlash against CRAs following the financial crisis led to extensive regulation of the industry,</li>
            <li>To reduce their influence and hold them accountable decoupling CRA ratings from prudential regulation, policymakers can create a more competitive and innovative credit rating industry that better serves the needs of the financial system</li>
            <li>which would not only improve the quality and reliability of creditworthiness assessments but also reduce the risks of over-reliance on a few dominant players.</li>
